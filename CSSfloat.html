                Goa is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a
                Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s
                tropical
                spice
                plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to
                those
                in
                laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda

                In the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka of
                Magadha.
                Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century
                AD,
                Goa was ruled by the Bhojas of Goa. Chutus of Karwar also ruled some parts as feudatories of the
                Satavahanas
